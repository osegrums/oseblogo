description: Downgrading Ruby on Arch linux


<p>
  Arch Linux is nice distro. It tries to use edge releases.
  But sometimes it is necessary to use some older and more mature versions of software.
</p>

<p>
  This is the case when I needed Ruby 1.8.6. Ruby 1.8.6 is stable version and
  many production Rails applications use exactly this version.
  Problem raised when I discovered that Arch linux now has Ruby 1.8.7.

<p>
  This is first time I faced <a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ABS">ABS</a>.
  I have to admit that I am not very big fan of reading large manuals, so I was very glad that I found ready made PKGBUILD
  file for Ruby 1.8.6 <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=519650#p519650">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  After that it was just matter of typing :) :
</p>

<p>
  First I had to make ABS tree <a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ABS">Get Started: Install Packages </a>.<br />
  After that:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
cd ~
mkdir ABS
mkdir ruby-1.8.6
vim PKGBUILD</pre>
  
  Fill file with example above.<br />
  Next:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
makepkg
sudo pacman -U ruby...</pre>
</p>

<p>
  That`s it. I have Ruby 1.8.6 installed.
